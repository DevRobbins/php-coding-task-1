1. Assume you have arrays where each array holds client information that follows this format: 
   [‘first’ => ‘’, ‘last’ => ‘’, ‘email’ => ‘’] 
   Write a function that does a loose comparison, returning true if any 2 of the 3 keys have the same value.

2. Write a function that will be passed two strings of random length. 
   Have your function return a string with all characters that appear in both strings.
